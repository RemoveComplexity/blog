PyCon 2018 has come to an end. A bittersweet feeling still lingers with me after a few days of returning to my usual routine.
Thankfully, I was able to interact with a lot of interesting people. The venue's air was always filled with ideas.
Navigating from conversation to conversation, planting curious seeds in any attentive mind nearby.
Authors of widely used libraries and frameworks were being humanazied by all the interactions between said authors and
the rest of the community. Little by little GitHub handles transformed into approachable peers.
A welcoming sense of belonging filled the halls.
One could truly appreciate the great effort from the organizers which was poured into this conference.
An event made by the python community for the python community.

KeyNotes

To this day I am not sure how any conference select their keynotes.
I assume the conference chairs get together and take into consideration anyone who, in the past year, has done anything noticable enough.
Noticeable enough is probably measured by the impact in the community as a whole.
This is only an assumption, which is as good as any assumption from any other carbon based person.
I can only imagine how hard this exercise might be.

The first keynote was by Eric Something.
He talked about the work he's done in the Mozilla Foundation.
We can also thank him for all the work done to PyPI these past months.
Eric also presented WebAssembly, which is a very interesting project allowing to bring different technologies to the browser and the web.
