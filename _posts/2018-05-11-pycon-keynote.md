#### Keynote (Dan Callahan - PyPI) @callahad

Started to talk about IBM's beginning (I'm going to talk about platforms).
IBM was a bad computer. Dan's father decided to buy a computer because of IBM and he started on an IBM.
Dan strated with basic and he didn't realized but the languages he was going to use were being chosen by him.
The platform he was using will influence what programming languages he was going to use.
He strated with some linux and php but felt inadequate. He remembers TI-82 and how he used to do stuff with basic on it.
What would computers look like for his child's generation.

Mozilla uses a lot of python. Python is a tool. This year he realized he moved to platforms where python don't have great stories.
"Python is the 2nd best language for everything". This is good because python is versatile.
"Why are we programming if not to serve people and solve human problems?"
Python isn't the 2nd best choice. Looks around (linux, etc...) python is an amazing tool. But there's also Androind, IOS, etc...
This is the platform that is at hand. 1/3 of children own their own tablet.
Those children will use tools that are ok on those devices.
The Web is a consolidating platform. Fridges with OSs with browsers on it.
Nobody know what is going to happen in the future but any future platform will have access to the web.
No central controll, it is comptetitive and W3c helps on getting the web everywhere.
Javascript is popular because it is nataive to the web.

Maybe we can put python on the web. For instance, we already have python notebooks. Notebooks are in your browser because the browser is a good platform.
Python is good at things that JS is not. There are still good things build with JS despite it's "flaws".
The problem with python is that it has to run somewhere. If we could bring python to the web then we can bring python everywhere.

The solution is Webassembly, is a complement of javascript.
Low level languages pros are portability and performance like numpy uses C.
Most programming lanaguages makes it easy to talk between high level and low level.
So, what is this in the web?
You can write somethin in web assembly and compile it then use it in python or you can run it in your browser.
AutoCAD and compiled it directly in a browser using WebAssembly. Shown on Google I/O

"The birth & Death of Javascript". That talk was old using Windows 3
He fired up windows 3! (a video of an emulator) and then netscape. IT still feels like the web and that is running on FireFox.
We can start looking at the web like a computer. Can we just compile python on the web and that's it?
No, python needs a CPU.
PyPi.js is pypi compiled into the web!
sometimes you don't want all of python, maybe you just want list comprehensions.

How do we bring python to the web? We don't know but we have some tools to start!
