Attending PyCon has been in my wishlist for a while now.
This year I convinced myself to do everything possible to attend PyCon 2018.
I decided I had to earn it. I know, this sounds intense, it's not.
First of all there are no requirements to attend PyCon (other than  buying a ticket)
Second, By "earn it" I meant to, at least, submit a proposal. And I already had a few ideas.
Third, PyCon  has a lot of opportunities to get involved, help  out and meet some awesome people.
Coincidentally my criteria of "earn it" was to either submit a proposal (as mentioned before),
become a reviewer and/or volunteer for something.
I'll  expand  on  he first two on this article.
Volunteerin for something on the actuall conference was quickly out of the quiestion because of work related reason which I won't mention. Mainly because these reasons  are boring and not particularly aligned to the context of this article.
Since we are on he tooic of Things I Won't Be Talking About Here,
I should mention I won't be describing in too much detail the PyCon reviewing process.
If you would  like to know  more about the actual  reviewing process the author of the ProgCom platform wrote  about it
back  in  2015 and Eric wrote a wonderful article about it, too. Eric was also a ProgCom member this year.

Ths is how  back  in  Dec 2017 I started giving form to some  talk  proposal  ideas.
-- I have never put together a tutorial. Naturally I'm hesitant about submitting a tutorial proposal, Maybe next year.--
I had three ideas. These were really raw ideas. A first draft title and, at least, two  main topics.
I decided to use the Metaprogramming/Metaclasses topic.
I decided on this  topic for two reasons:
1. I  find it very interesting
2. I have used metaprogramming in  different projects and  I've seen some  idely used libraries/frameworks use it  aucceasfully
I should say I  m fully aware of  he 99%. I still himk  the topic is really interesting.
also, times have changed and I believe there're more  uses than only 1%.
The proposal was not accepted. 


1. The review process leverages the community.
  1.1 There are different stages.
  1.2 Reviewer come from different backgrounds.
  1.3 The community builds the conference.
2. I learned a lot from reading proposals and talking to other ProgCom members.
  2.1 I am not an expert on every proposal.
  2.2 It is OK to do some research.
  2.3 Clarity and audience matters.
3. It is OK if your proposal is not accepted.
