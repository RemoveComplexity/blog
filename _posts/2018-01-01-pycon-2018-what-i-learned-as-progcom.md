Attending PyCon has been in my wishlist for a while now. This year I convinced myself to do everything possible to attend PyCon 2018.
I decided I had to earn it. I know, this sounds intense, it's not. First of all there are no requirements to attend PyCon (other than  buying a ticket).
Second, By "earn it" I meant to, at least, submit a proposal. And I already had a few ideas.
Third, PyCon  has a lot of opportunities to get involved, help  out and meet some awesome people.
Coincidentally my criteria of "earn it" was to either submit a proposal (as mentioned before), become a reviewer and/or volunteer for something.
I'll  expand  on  he first two on this article.

Being a PyCon volunteer was quickly out of the question because of work related reason which I won't mention.
Mainly because these reasons are boring and not particularly aligned to the context of this article.
Since we are on he topic of Things I Won't Be Talking About Here, I should mention I won't be describing in too much detail the PyCon reviewing process.
If you would  like to know more about the actual reviewing process Ned Jackson Lovely
(the author of the ProgCom platform) [wrote about it][pycon-review-process] back  in  2015
and Eric J. Ma [wrote a wonderful article][erics-article] about it, too. Eric was also a part of PyCon's ProgCom this year (2018).

This is how  back  in  Dec 2017 I started giving form to some talk proposal ideas.
-- I have never put together a tutorial. Naturally I'm hesitant about submitting a tutorial proposal, Maybe next year.--
I had three ideas. These were really raw ideas. These ideas consisted of a first draft title and, at least, two  main topics.
I decided to use the metaprogramming topic.
I decided on this  topic for two reasons:

1. I  find it very interesting
2. I have used metaprogramming in  different projects and  I've seen some widely used libraries/frameworks use it successfully.

I should say I'm fully aware of the 99% quote. I still think the topic is really interesting.
Also, times have changed and I believe there are more  uses than only 1%. The proposal was not accepted. 


1. The review process leverages the community.
  1.1 There are different stages.
  1.2 Reviewer come from different backgrounds.
  1.3 The community builds the conference.
2. I learned a lot from reading proposals and talking to other ProgCom members.
  2.1 I am not an expert on every proposal.
  2.2 It is OK to do some research.
  2.3 Clarity and audience matters.
3. It is OK if your proposal is not accepted.
